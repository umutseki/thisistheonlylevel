# thisistheonlylevel
This project is an object-oriented Java implementation of the nostalgic game This Is the Only Level, created as part of the CmpE 160 course. Although the original game contains a single level, its challenge comes from multiple stages, each introducing a unique gameplay twist. Following the assignment specification provided by the course instructors, this implementation uses the StdDraw graphics library to render the game environment and handle all player interactions.
The game consists of a single level with multiple stages, each modifying mechanics such as movement, gravity, jumping behavior, or required button interactions. The player controls an elephant character and must reach the exit pipe while avoiding spikes, pressing buttons, opening a sliding door, and adapting to changing rules in each stage. The environment includes obstacles, spikes, a start pipe, an exit pipe, a door that opens only under certain conditions, a button linked to the door, and UI elements such as timers, death counters, help and clue messages, and restart/reset controls. These components and mechanics are based on the original assignment description in the provided specification.
The implementation follows a clear object-oriented design, consisting of four main classes besides the entry point: Stage, Player, Map, and Game. The Stage class stores movement parameters, gravity, key bindings, clues, and dynamic obstacle colors for each stage. The Player class represents the elephant with position, velocity, dimensions, and drawing logic. The Map class contains the full environment—obstacles, pipes, spikes, door, button—and handles collision detection, button presses, door animation, player movement, and stage transitions. The Game class coordinates user input, runs the game loop, switches stages, updates timers, manages deaths, and displays stage-passing or end-game banners, exactly as described in the assignment’s UML diagrams.
The game supports all required mechanics: normal movement, reversed controls, automatic jumping with altered gravity and velocity parameters, special button logic requiring multiple presses, restarting a stage upon death, and resetting the entire game state. Visual elements—such as the timer area, help and restart buttons, banner messages, and dynamic obstacle colors—are rendered in real time using StdDraw. Overall, this project demonstrates object-oriented design, collision handling, animation, event-driven input, and structured game-loop development within the constraints defined by the assignment.
